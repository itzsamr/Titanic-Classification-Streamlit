# Titanic-Classification-Streamlit

This project is a simple machine-learning classification model that predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features. It uses the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers' attributes and whether they survived or not.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/itzsamr/Titanic-Classification-Streamlit.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd Titanic-Classification-Streamlit
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```shell
streamlit run titanic-classification.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server, and you will be able to access the application in your browser.

### Usage

Once the application is running, you will see the web interface in your browser. The interface allows you to input the details of a passenger and get a prediction of their survival on the Titanic.

1. Fill in the required information for the passenger, such as their age, gender, class, and so on.

2. Click on the "Predict" button to get the prediction.

3. The application will display the predicted survival status (0 for not survived, 1 for survived) for the provided passenger.

### Customization

If you want to modify or enhance the project, you can make changes to the `titanic-classification.py` file. You can also modify the interface by editing the Streamlit code in the same file.
